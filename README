In order to install my program, all you need to do is drag 
PathOfExileBravery.jar and all .txt files into a random folder. 
Feel free to edit the .txt files to your heart's content,
the program should be able to handle it. Just remember to
open them with notepad++ or something similar and keep each
entry on a separate line.

Cheers!
